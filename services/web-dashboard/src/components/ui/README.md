# UI Components

Base UI primitives and reusable components for the Smart City Sentinel dashboard.

## Purpose
This directory contains atomic UI components that are used across the application, such as buttons, cards, badges, and form elements.

## Guidelines
- Components should be presentational (no business logic)
- Use TailwindCSS for styling
- Export components from an `index.ts` barrel file
- Follow naming convention: `ComponentName.tsx`
